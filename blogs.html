            <p class="blog-content">Endless love for music Everyone has their “thing” right? Whether it be gambling, a sport, or the end of the next bottle of alcohol, we all have something we are drawn to. If you are lucky enough, the thing that interests you the most ends up being your occupation. Man, what a life.

                I have had many “things” throughout my twenty-six years of life. Some have stayed and some have went but there has been one thing that has stayed true: music. Music is the essence of my life, it provides, it nurtures, and it completes. I cannot be where I am at today without my unabated love for music.
