        <p>“I think music in itself is healing,” American musician Billy Joel once said. “It’s an explosive expression of humanity.
             It’s something we are all touched by. 
            No matter what culture we’re from, everyone loves music.” Most of us would wholeheartedly agree with this statement, 
            and it is this universal bond with music that has led researchers across the globe to 
            investigate its therapeutic potential.</p>

                Although we can’t be sure exactly when human beings began listening to music, scientists do know something about why we do. Listening to music benefits us individually and collectively. Here’s what research tells us 
                about the power of music to improve our physical, mental, and emotional health.
